There once was a boy whose hands had outgrown the rest of his body.
His name was Jim, but as the locals would know him, he was simply: Hands. 
Now these locals weren't your ordinary residents either, they had a dark long forgotton secret.
This secret had been hidden from Hands ever since he was a boy, but he was minute away from uncovering it once again.

After walking down an empty alleyway one night, Hands stumbled upon information that would change his perspective forever.
He saw a couple of the towns residents huddling together discussing something that seemed very important.
As he got closer to the residents, they all scattered as fast as they could.
But as they ran away, Hands got a closer look at something that would make him feel a lot less like an outsider. 

Hands found an old photograph that one of the residents had dropped as they ran away. In this picture, there was a man with abnormally large hands. Hands was very shocked by this image, and began to run in the direction that the residents ran to get answers.
