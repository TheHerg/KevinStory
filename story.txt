There once was a boy whose hands had outgrown the rest of his body.
His name was Jim, but as the locals would know him, he was simply: Hands. 
Now these locals weren't your ordinary residents either, they had a dark long forgotton secret.
This secret had been hidden from Hands ever since he was a boy, but he was minute away from uncovering it once again.
